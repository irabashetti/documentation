### Description
This command plays a laser-like sound for a time represented by `repeats`. A single `repeats` is roughly 
equivalent to that of a second. The laser-like sound is auto-generated by Nexial and is played over the currently active 
audio output device.

Much like other sound commands, the purpose of this one provides audio notification for an event of your choosing. Using
different `repeats`, one could customize distinguishing audio alert for different events.


### Parameters
- **repeats** - the number of seconds the laser sound should play. This must be a positive integer.
