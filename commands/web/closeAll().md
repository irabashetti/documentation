### Description
This command closes the current browser instance, effectively closing all open windows/tabs.  Note that all browser 
related operations will likely result in error after this command is executed â€“ except for [`open(url)`](open(url)) 
or [`openAndWait(url,waitMs)`](openAndWait(url,waitMs)), which will in turn create new browser instance as a result.

Closing a browser instance **DOES NOT** necessarily terminate any running web sessions on the corresponding server 
application.  Some cookies are created as 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/persistent_cookie.html" class="external-link" target="_nexial_target">persistent</a> 
and will remain as is between browser sessions.  Hence one should not rely on closing browser tab/window/instance as 
a guarantee to terminate or abandon web sessions.  Check [`webcookie`](../webcookie) page for available commands 
regarding cookies.


#### For Electron Applications Only
For electron application, it is possible to forcefully terminating the application (AUT) when this command is invoked.
Depending on the target application, it may be necessary to do so in order to ensure all previously in-use resources
are released for future use. To forcefully terminate the target application, set the System variable
[`nexial.browser.electron.forceTerminate`](../../systemvars/index#nexial.browser.electron.forceTerminate) to `true` 
(default is `false`)
