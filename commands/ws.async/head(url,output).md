### Description
> This command is similar to [its `ws` counterpart](../ws/head(url,var)), except for the asynchronous HTTP 
invocation and response handling. 

This command is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. The meta 
information contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent 
in response to a GET request. This command can be used for obtaining meta information about the entity implied by the 
request without transferring the entity-body itself. This command is often used for testing hypertext links for 
validity, accessibility, and recent modification. The response will be saved to `output`. To learn about how to 
manipulate the response returned from the target URL, visit [HTTP Response](index#http-response).


### Parameters
- **url** - the target URL
- **output**Â - the file to save the [request and response information](index.html#http-response)
