### Description
This command is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. The meta 
information contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent 
in response to a GET request. This command can be used for obtaining meta information about the entity implied by the 
request without transferring the entity-body itself. This command is often used for testing hypertext links for 
validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
